[STAGE]
# StageMethod defines how cars are staged
#	Local:  Prompts for a car number
#	Remote: Queries /stage until a car is staged
# StageMethod = Local
StageMethod = Remote
# GreenLightPin defines the GPIO pin for the green light.
# If StageMethod is Local and this is defined, then
# cars will not be started until this pin is triggered.
# GreenLightMethod defines whether high or low is the trigger.
# GreenLightPin = 12
# GreenLightMethod = LOW

[BEAMS]
# Maps each logical beam to a physical beam.
# Start and finish are required, splits are not yet implemented.
# Type definnes the type of beam (FDS, GPIO or Test)
# ID defines which beam:
#	FDS:  The ID of the FDS beam (1,2,3,4,M1,M2)
#	GPIO: The GPIO pin used for that beam.
