# autosolo-timing
A timing display system for AutoSolo events to show the current class and overall standings on static Raspbarry Pi screens and mobile web browsers.  The intention is to use a Raspberry Pi as a WiFi access point, web server and MySQL database.  Times will be stored in the database, edited directly with LibreOffice.  The web server will present the current times in a tablular format, ordered by class or overall and either to fit a screen resolution directly with no scrolling or for a mobile device.

## Future Enhancements

Some thinking for the future...
* Graphs showing class progression
* Upload to a cloud service when data is available for live(ish) online timing
* Integration with a mobile app for adding times directly from the finish line

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Raspberry Pi to install the software on and at least one screen to display the results on!

### Installing

TBD...

## Running the tests

Some automated testing would be lovely.  Any takers?

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
