# autosolo-timing
A timing display system for AutoSolo events to show the current class and overall standings on static Raspbarry Pi screens and mobile web browsers.

Main app is at https://github.com/mabware

## Future Enhancements

Some thinking for the future...
* Graphs showing class progression
* Upload to a cloud service when data is available for live(ish) online timing
* Integration with a mobile app for adding times directly from the finish line
* Images from a camera overlaid with times for social media uploads

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* You'll need a device (Windows/Linux) and at least one screen to display the results on!
* Python 3

### Installing

No installation yet.  Run the server at the link above and run the trackside software at ./pi/livetiming.py

## Running the tests

Some automated testing would be lovely.  Any takers?

### Break down into end to end tests
